Text bounded by dashed lines below is minicom capture and sample of
output from Pico-SDK sample application dubbed "advanced UART".  This
sample app configures an RP2040 UART for use with DMA, and sets up
a hardware interrupt. 

The sample app specifically processes one characters at a time from the
UART's RX buffer, increments its ASCII value by one and echoes that
incremented value back via the TX line.  This incrementing is evident
in the output.

Minicom defaults to terminal "echo off".  The echo of user input to
minicom has been turned on to produce the captured sample app output
interlaced with user input:
